# SPARC - Spined Quadruped Robot

A comprehensive research project featuring a biomimetic quadruped robot with an active spine mechanism. This repository serves as a reference implementation for our research paper and contains hardware designs, circuit schematics, and control simulation code for a spined quadruped robot.

## Overview

SPARC (Spined Quadruped Robot) is a research platform that explores the integration of active spine mechanisms in quadruped locomotion. By incorporating a flexible spine unit, the robot achieves enhanced mobility, stability, and biomimetic movement patterns similar to those observed in quadruped animals.

## Features

- **Biomimetic Design**: Inspired by the natural spine mechanics of quadruped animals
- **Active Spine Mechanism**: Dynamic spine actuation for improved locomotion performance
- **Complete Hardware Design**: 3D models and mechanical designs for robot construction
- **Circuit Design**: Electronic control systems and PCB layouts
- **Control Simulation**: Mathematical models and simulation frameworks for testing and validation
- **Modular Architecture**: Flexible design allowing for easy modification and experimentation
